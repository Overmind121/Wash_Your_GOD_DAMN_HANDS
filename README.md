# Wash_Your_GOD_DAMN_HANDS
This is a project that will incentivize people to wash their god damn hands for 20 seconds. This project uses a neural net, raspberry pi, and arduino to operate it.
Please note, that I am using data that focuses on my sinks only so the model will most likely not work for anyone else's as the data is biased. 
If you want to use this model, you'll have to film and use my data generator program to get the data you need to train the neural net.
